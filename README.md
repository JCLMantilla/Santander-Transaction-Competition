# Santander-Transaction-Competition

Welcome to this really interesting project that I am working on! This is the Kaggle competition with the most teams participating, and it serves as a really good exercise since in order to make it into the top 5% you have to ***push your machine learning skills***.

In order to make it to the top 5% or more I will be focusing on these 3 important aspects:

1) ***Testing, and learning how to fine-tune the new release of "Histogram Based Gradient boosting classifier" from Scikit-Learnarn:*** At the date when this project is being done, Scikit-Learn just released the experimental version of what is basically their implementation of **LightGBM**, which as you might know already, it is one of the most powerful (if not the most) ensemble algorithms together with XGBoost. Almost all of the top 1% of solutions use ensemble methods in regression and classification competitions, and no wonder, since it has been shown that boosting algorithms can outperform most classification/regression algorithms that exist nowadays.
Boosting algorithms are really hard to fine-tune and to use efficiently, but learning how to use them can be very rewarding, and that's exactly what I am going to do here.
2) ***Extensive data preprocessing and manipulation with Pandas:*** I am going to give a lot of work to extensive data preprocessing and manipulation, which we are going to be carried out in the most optimized way possible way. This part of the project is going to be done solely on the DataGeneration notebook.
3) ***Dealing with an unbalanced dataset by creating synthetic samples using Imbalanced-Learn:***
4)
