# Santander-Transaction-Competition
Welcome to this really interesting project that I am working in! The main ideas of competing in the public leaderboard are the following

1) This is the Kaggle competition with the most teams participaing in. Even though the competition already ended, you can still compete with your models againts thousands of Data Scientist to proove your skills.

2) The aproach I am going to take on this project serves as a really good exercise to display my skills, since It will require the following:
  Extensive data preprocessisng and manipulation with Pandas, which we are going to be carried out in the most optimized way possible way.
